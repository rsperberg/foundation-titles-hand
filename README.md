Foundation, the Apple TV+ show made from the Isaac Asimov books (of which only four episodes had been released when this font was first published), uses a number of fonts with related design for the logo, on-screen text, in-scene signage and the title credits.  Only in the last of these are most letters represented.

Foundationâ€™s title sequence was created by Imaginary Forces, a Los Angeles design studio and creative agency (imaginaryforces.com), and presumably IF created the specific design used for names in the title credits.  In this font, I have hand-drawn the characters seen on-screen, excepting Q, which does not appear; that is my invention.  Lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols and punctuation (other than & and . and ,) are also not used, hence their omission here initially.  [Note: Until authoritative designs appear, the fonts will rely on "compatible conjectures" for practicality.  Preliminary versions of the main non-letter glyphs in the Basic Latin Unicode block have been constructed and kerned, and the 0.85 version of both fonts includes them.]

The source .archive files are in the file format used by iFontMaker, the iPad font-design tool made by Eiji and Tom, Inc., which you can find at 2ttf.com.

This font is released under the OFL, the SIL Open Font License.

A font based on the <a href="https://github.com/rsperberg/foundation-logo" title="Jump to Foundation Logo repo"> Foundation Logo</a> is also in progress, and a <a href="https://github.com/rsperberg/foundation-screen" title="Jump to Foundation Screen repo">font</a> based on the type design seen on computer screens in Foundation is planned.
