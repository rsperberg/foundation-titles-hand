Foundation, the Apple TV+ show made from the Isaac Asimov books (of which only four episodes had been released when this font was first published), uses a number of fonts with related design for the logo, on-screen text, in-scene signage and the title credits.  Only in the last of these are most letters represented.

Foundationâ€™s title sequence was created by Imaginary Forces, a Los Angeles design studio and creative agency (imaginaryforces.com), and presumably IF created the specific design used for names in the title credits.  In this font, I have hand-drawn the characters seen on-screen, excepting Q, which does not appear; that is my invention.  Lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols and punctuation (other than & and . and ,) are also not used, hence their omission here currently. [Note: Until authoritative glyphs appear, the fonts will rely on "credible conjectures" for practicality. The apostrophe, exclamation mark, hyphen and em and en dashes are the first such supplements to be constructed and kerned, and a new version of the fonts has been published to include them.]

The source .archive files are in the file format used by iFontMaker, the iPad font-design tool made by Eiji and Tom, Inc., which you can find at 2ttf.com.

This font is released under the OFL, the SIL Open Font License.
