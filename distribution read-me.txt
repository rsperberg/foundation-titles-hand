About the Foundation Titles Hand font

Foundation, the Apple TV+ series made from the Isaac Asimov books (and which has released only four episodes as I write this), uses a number of fonts with related design for the logo, on-screen text, in-scene signage and the title credits.  Only in the last of these are most letters represented.

Foundationâ€™s title sequence was created by Imaginary Forces, a Los Angeles design studio and creative agency (imaginaryforces.com), and presumably IF created the specific design used for names in the title credits.  In this font, I have hand-drawn the letters seen on-screen, excepting Q, which does not appear; that is my invention.  Lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols and punctuation (other than & and . and ,) are also not used, hence their omission here initially.  [Note: Until authoritative glyphs appear, the fonts will rely on "compatible conjectures" for practicality.  The apostrophe, exclamation mark, hyphen and em and en dashes are the first such supplements to be constructed and kerned, and a new version of the fonts has been published to include them.]

Foundation Titles Hand is released under the SIL Open Font License; more information and the source file for the font (in the iFontMaker format) can be found at https://github.com/rsperberg/foundation-titles-hand
